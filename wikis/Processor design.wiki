    * [[https://github.com/goglecm/gpapd|GPAPD]]: General Purpose Asynchronous Processor Design

= Processor design =

The design of a processor consists of a few stages:
    * architecture design - define what are the top level modules, their duties
      and how they interact with one another. Also, define the goals of the
      processor, in terms of parallelism, performance, EM interference, power
      consumption, compatibility, testability, usability, etc.
    * module decomposition - define the micro-architectures of each modules, up
      to the level of basic building blocks.
    * RTL block design - implement each basic block using  HDL language, and
      connect them together to form modules and sub-modules.
    * RTL synthesis - convert the RTL implementation into a lower level circuit
      implementation (gates and transistors).

During each of the design stages, the processor should be tested. There are
various testing techniques depending on the type of processor being designed.
These include formal validation and verification.
